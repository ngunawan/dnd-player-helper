        </h1>
        <p>Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful in comprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.</p>

            <h2>Proud Dragon Kin
                <a class="headerlink" href="#proud-dragon-kin" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>
            </h2>
            <p>Dragon born look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings ora tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6.5 feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.</p>
            <p>The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon an cestor—bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.</p>

            <h2>Self-Sufficient Clans
                <a class="headerlink" href="#self-sufficient-clans" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>
            </h2>
            <p>To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragon born owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragon born ’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.</p>
            <p>A continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragon born value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give upon something. Ad ragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.</p>
            <p>Though all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races—or even from the gods.</p>

            <h2>Uncommon Races
                <a class="headerlink" href="#uncommon-races" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>
            </h2>
            <p>The dragonborn and the rest of the races in this chapter are uncommon. They don’t exist in every world of D&amp;D, and even where they are found, they are less widespread than dwarves, elves, halflings, and humans.</p>
            <p>In the cosmopolitan cities of the D&amp;D multiverse, most people hardly look twice at members of even the most exotic races. But the small towns and villages that dot the countryside are different. The common folk aren’t accustomed to seeing members of these races, and they react accordingly.</p>
            <p><strong>Dragonborn.</strong> It’s easy to assume that a dragonborn is a monster, especially if his or her scales betray achromatic heritage. Unless the dragonborn starts breathing fire and causing destruction, though, people are likely to respond with caution rather than outright fear.</p>
            <p><strong>Gnome.</strong> Gnomes don’t look like a threat and can quickly disarm suspicion with good humor. The common folk are often curious about gnomes, likely never having seen one before, but they are rarely hostile or fearful.</p>
            <p><strong>Half-Elf.</strong> Although many people have never seen a half-elf, virtually everyone knows they exist. A half-elfstranger’s arrival is followed by gossip behind the half-elf&#8217;s back and stolen glances across the common room, rather than any confrontation or open curiosity.</p>
            <p><strong>Half-Orc.</strong> It’s usually safe to assume that a half-orc is belligerent and quick to anger, so people watch themselves around an unfamiliar half-orc. Shopkeepers might surreptitiously hide valuable or fragile goods when a half-orc comes in, and people slowly clear out of a tavern, assuming a fight will break out soon.</p>
            <p><strong>Tiefling.</strong> Half-orcs are greeted with a practical caution, but tieflings are the subject of supernatural fear. The evil of their heritage is plainly visible in their features, and as far as most people are concerned, a tiefling could very well be a devil straight from the Nine Hells. People might make warding signs as a tiefling approaches, cross the street to avoid passing near, or bar shop doors before a tiefling can enter.</p>

            <p><strong>Breath Weapon.</strong> You can use your action to exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation. When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4 d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.</p>
            <p>After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>
            <p><strong>Damage Resistance.</strong> You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.</p>
            <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and sibilants.</p>
