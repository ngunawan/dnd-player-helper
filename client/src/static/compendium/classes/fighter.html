    <p>A human in clanging plate armor holds her shield before her as she runs toward the massed goblins. An elf behind her, clad in studded leather armor, peppers the goblins with arrows loosed from his exquisite bow. The half-orc nearby shouts orders, helping the two combatants coordinate their assault to the best advantage.</p>
    <p>A dwarf in chain mail interposes his shield between the ogre’s club and his companion, knocking the deadly blow aside. His companion, a half—elfin scale armor, swings two scimitars in a blinding whirl as she circles the ogre, looking for a blind spot in its defenses.</p>
    <p>A gladiator fights for sport in an arena, a master with his trident and net, skilled at toppling foes and moving them around for the crowd&#8217;s delight—and his own tactical advantage. His opponent’s sword ﬂares with blue light an instant before she sends lightning ﬂashing forth to smite him.</p>
    <p>All of these heroes are fighters, perhaps the most diverse class of Characters in the worlds of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Questing knights, conquering overlords, royal champions, elite foot soldiers, hardened mercenaries, and bandit kings-as fighters, they all share an unparalleled mastery with weapons and armor, and a thorough knowledge of the skills of combat. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and staring it defiantly in the face.</p>

            <h3>Well—Rounded Specialists<a class="headerlink" href="#wellrounded-specialists" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
            <p>Fighters learn the basics of all combat styles. Every fighter can swing an axe, fence with a rapier, wield a longsword or a greatsword, use a bow, and even trap foes in a net with some degree of skill. Likewise, a fighter is adept with shields and every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each fighter specializes in a certain style of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad general ability and extensive specialization makes fighters superior combatants on battlefields and in dungeons alike.</p>

            <p>Not every member of the city watch, the Village militia, or the queens army is a fighter. Most of these troops are relatively untrained soldiers with only the most basic combat knowledge. Veteran soldiers, military officers, trained bodyguards, dedicated knights, and similar figures are fighters.</p>
            <p>Some fighters feel drawn to use their training as adventurers. The dungeon delving. monster slaying, and other dangerous work common among adventurers is second nature for a fighter, not all that different from the life he or she left behind. There are greater risks. perhaps, but also much greater rewardswfew fighters in the city watch have the opportunity to discover a magic ﬂame tongue sword, for example.</p>

            <h3>Creating a Fighter<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-fighter" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
            <p>As you build your fighter. think about two related elements of your character&#8217;s background: Where did you get your combat training. and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication. What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge. or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors.</p>
            <p>You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble’s army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics. and military history. Or you might be self—taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and deaths embrace.</p>

On a failed save, you push the target up to 15 feet away from you.</p>
                <p><strong>Rally.</strong> On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.</p>
                <p><strong>Riposte.</strong> When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction and expend one superiority die to make a melee weapon attack against the creature. If you hit, you add the superiority die to the attack&#8217;s damage roll.</p>
                <p><strong>Sweeping Attack.</strong> When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to damage another creature with the same attack. Choose another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within your reach. If the original attack roll would hit the second creature, it takes damage equal to the number you roll on your superiority die. The damage is of the same type dealt by the original attack.</p>
                <p><strong>Trip Attack.</strong> When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to knock the target down. You add the superiority die to the attacks damage roll, and if the target is Large or smaller, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you knock the target prone.</p>

            <h3>Eldritch Knight<a class="headerlink" href="#eldritch-knight" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
            <p>The archetypal Eldritch Knight combines the martial mastery common to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by Wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighters reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.</p>

                <h4>Spellcasting<a class="headerlink" href="#spellcasting" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
                <p>When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</p>
                <p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
                <p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of lst level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p>For example, if you know the lst—level spell shield and have a lst—level and a 2nd—level spell slot available, you can cast shield using either slot.</p>
                <p><strong>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</strong> You know three lst-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list.</p>
                <p>The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of lst level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice, and mus be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of lst or 2nd level.</p>
                <p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
                <p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th. or 20th level.</p>
                <p><strong>Spellcasting Ability.</strong> Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>

                <p>At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be Within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond.</p>
                <p>Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can&#8217;t be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.</p>
                <p>You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action.</p>
                <p>If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.</p>
