        <p>Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, a half—elf springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.</p>
        <p>Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes.</p>
        <p>Moving with the silence of the night, a black—clad halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a stone&#8217;s throw away. She slides her blade free of its cloth- Wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.</p>
        <p>Whatever their discipline. monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.</p>

                <p>Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element</p>
                <p>of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power Within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies&#8217; physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more. power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.</p>

                <p>Small walled Cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&amp;D. tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn’t be found to support them. or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.</p>
                <p>Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.</p>
                <p>The majority of monks don’t shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.</p>
                <p>For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don’t undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth.</p>
                <p>As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.</p>

                </h3>
                <p>The worlds of D&amp;D contain a multitude of monasteries and monastic traditions. in lands with an Asian cultural flavor, such as Shou Lung far to the east ofthe Forgotten</p>
                <p>Realms, these monasteries are associated with philosophical traditions and martial arts practice. The Iron Hand School, the Five Stars School, the Northern Fist School, and</p>
                <p>the Southern Star School of Shou Lung teach different approaches to the physical, mental, and spiritual disciplines ofthe monk. Some ofthese monasteries have spread to the western lands of Faerun, particularly in places with large Shou immigrant communities, such as Thesk and Westgate.</p>
                <p>Other monastic traditions are associated with deities who teach the value of physical excellence and mental discipline. In the Forgotten Realms, the order ofthe Dark Moon is made up ofmonks dedicated to Shar (goddess ofloss), who maintain secret communities in remote hills, back allies, and subterranean hideaways. Monasteries ofllmater (god ofendurance) are named after flowers, and their orders carry the names of great heroes ofthe faith; the Disciples of Saint Sollars the Twice-Martyred reside in the Monastery of the Yellow Rose near Damara. The monasteries ofEberron combine the study of martial arts with a life of scholarship. Most are devoted to the deities ofthe Sovereign Host. in the world of Dragonlance, most monks are devoted to Majere, god of meditation and thought. In Greyhawk, many monasteries are dedicated to Xan Yae, the goddess oftwilight and the superiority of mind over matter, or to Zuoken, god of mental and physical mastery.</p>
                <p>The evil monks ofthe Scarlet Brotherhood in the world of Greyhawk derive their fanatic zeal not from devotion to a god but from dedication to the principles oftheir nation and their race—the beliefthat the Suel strand ofhumanity are meant to rule the world.</p>

                <p>As you make your monk character. think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery’s threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?</p>
                <p>Consider Why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the Cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community’s rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?</p>
                <p>As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.</p>

For example, if you are a 5th-level monk and use Sweeping Cinder Strike to cast burning hands, you can spend 3 ki points to cast it as a 2nd—level spell (the discipline’s base cost of 2 ki points plus 1).</p>
                    <p>The maximum number of ki points you can spend to cast a spell in this way (including its base ki point cost and any additional ki points you spend to increase its level) is determined by your monk level, as shown in the Spells and Ki Points table.</p>
