        <h1>Druid<a class="headerlink" href="#druid" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
        <p>Holding high a gnarled staff wreathed with holly, an elf summons the fury of the storm and calls down explosive bolts of lightning to smite the torch—carrying orcs Who threaten her forest.</p>
        <p>Crouching out of sight on a high tree branch in the form of a leopard, a human peers out of the jungle at the strange construction of a temple of Evil Elemental Air, keeping a close eye on the cultists’ activities.</p>
        <p>Swinging a blade formed of pure ﬁre, a half—elf charges into a mass of skeletal soldiers, sundering the unnatural magic that gives the foul creatures the mocking semblance of life.</p>
        <p>Whether calling on the elemental forces of nature or emulating the creatures of the animal world, druids are an embodiment of nature’s resilience, cunning, and fury. They claim no mastery over nature. Instead. they see themselves as extensions of nature’s indomitable will.</p>

                <h3>Power of Nature<a class="headerlink" href="#power-of-nature" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
                <p>Druids revere nature above all, gaining their spells and other magical powers either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. Many druids pursue a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devotion to a divine entity, while others serve gods of Wild nature, animals, or elemental forces. The ancient druidic traditions are sometimes called the Old Faith, in contrast to the worship of gods in temples and shrines.</p>
                <p>Druid spells are oriented toward nature and animals— the power of tooth and claw, of sun and moon, of ﬁre and storm. Druids also gain the ability to take on animal forms, and some druids make a particular study of this practice, even to the point where they prefer animal form to their natural form.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Preserve the Balance<a class="headerlink" href="#preserve-the-balance" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
                <p>For druids, nature exists in a precarious balance. The four elements that make up a world-air, earth, ﬁre, and water—must remain in equilibrium. If one element were to gain power over the others, the world could be destroyed, drawn into one of the elemental planes and broken apart into its component elements. Thus. druids oppose cults of Elemental Evil and others who promote one element to the exclusion of others. Druids are also concerned with the delicate ecological balance that sustains plant and animal life, and the need for civilized folk to live in harmony with nature. not in opposition to it. Druids accept that which is cruel in nature, and they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and mind ﬂayers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when the monsters encroach on the druids&#8217; territory. Druids are often found guarding sacred sites or watching over regions of unspoiled nature. But when a signiﬁcant danger arises, threatening nature’s balance or the lands they protect, druids take on a more active role in combating the threat, as adventurers.</p>

                <h3>Sacred Plants and Wood<a class="headerlink" href="#sacred-plants-and-wood" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
                <p>A druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash, birch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow, and yew. Druids often use such plants as part ofa spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>
                <p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hatts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used forthrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>
                <p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid ofa desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>

                <h3>Druids and the Gods<a class="headerlink" href="#druids-and-the-gods" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
                <p>Some druids venerate the forces ofnature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one ofthe many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix</p>
                <p>B include many such deities). The worship ofthese deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths ofclerics and urbanized peoples. In fact, in the world of Greyhawk, the druidic faith is called the Old Faith, and it claims many adherents among farmers, foresters, ﬁshers, and others who live closely with nature. This tradition includes the worship of Nature as a primal force beyond personification, but also encompasses the worship of Beory, the Oerth Mother, as well as devotees ofObad-Hai, Ehlonna, and Ulaa.</p>
                <p>In the worlds ofGreyhawk and the Forgotten Realms, druidic circles are not usually connected to the faith ofa single nature deity. Any given circle in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might include druids who revere Silvanus, Mielikki, Eldath, Chauntea, or even the harsh Gods of Fury: Talos, Malar, Auril, and Umberlee. These nature gods are often called the First Circle, the first among the druids, and most druids count them all (even the violent ones) as worthy ofveneration.
                </p>
                <p>The druids of Eberron hold animistic beliefs completely unconnected to the Sovereign Host, the Dark Six, or any of the other religions ofthe world. They believe that every living thing and evew natural phenomenon—sun, moon, wind, fire, and the world itself—has a spirit. Their spells, then, are a means to communicate with and command these spirits. Diﬁferent druidic sects, though, hold diﬁerent philosophies about the proper relationship ofthese spirits to each other and to the forces ofcivilization. The Ashbound, for example, believe that arcane magic is an abomination against nature, the Children ofWinter venerate the forces of death, and the Gatekeepers preserve ancient traditions meant to protect the world from the incursion of aberrations.</p>

                <p>When making a druid, consider why your character has such a close bond with nature. Perhaps your character lives in a society where the Old Faith still thrives, or was raised by a druid after being abandoned in the depths of a forest. Perhaps your character had a dramatic encounter with the spirits of nature, coming face to</p>
                <p>face with a giant eagle or dire wolf and surviving the experience. Maybe your character was born during an epic storm or a volcanic eruption, which was interpreted as a sign that becoming a druid was part of your character’s destiny. Have you always been an adventurer as part of your druidic calling. or did you ﬁrst spend time as a caretaker of a sacred grove or spring? Perhaps your homeland was befouled by evil. and you took up an adventuring life in hopes of ﬁnding a new home or purpose.</p>

                    <p>The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell‘s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you ﬁnish a long rest.</p>
                    <p>You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modiﬁer + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
                    <p>For example, if you are a 3rd—1evel druid. you have four lst—level and two 2nd—level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the lst—level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a lst—level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn&#8217;t remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>
                    <p>You can also change your list of prepared spells when you ﬁnish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>

                <p>You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.</p>
                <p>While you are transformed, the following rules apply:</p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proﬁcien cies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proﬁciency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can&#8217;t use them. When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.</li>
                    <li>You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as cal] lightning, that you’ve already cast.</li>
                    <li>You retain the beneﬁt of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvi— sion, unless your new form also has that sense.</li>
                    <li>You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment. based on the crea— ture’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.</li>

            <h2>Druid Circles<a class="headerlink" href="#druid-circles" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
            <p>Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, druids are part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any high—ranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. Druids recognize each other as brothers an sisters. Like creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other.</p>
            <p>At a local scale, druids are organized into circles that share certain perspectives on nature, balance, and the way of the druid.</p>

                <h3>Circle of the Land<a class="headerlink" href="#circle-of-the-land" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h3>
                <p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet Within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circles wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is inﬂuenced by the land Where you were initiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.</p>

                    <p>When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional druid cantrip of your choice.</p>

                    <h4>Natural Recovery<a class="headerlink" href="#natural-recovery" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
                    <p>Starting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by sitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a short rest, you choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can&#8217;t use this feature again until you finish a long rest</p>
                    <p>For example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd—level slot or two lst—level slots.</p>

                <div class="section" id="circle-spells">
                    <h4>Circle Spells<a class="headerlink" href="#circle-spells" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h4>
                    <p>Your mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th. 7th, and 9th level you gain access to circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid. Choose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland. mountain, swamp, or Underdark—and consult the associated list of spells.</p>
                    <p>Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn&#8217;t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list. the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.</p>

                    <p>The creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack against you.</p>
