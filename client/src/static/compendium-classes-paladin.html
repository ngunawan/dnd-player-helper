    <h1>Paladin
        <a class="headerlink" href="#paladin" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>
    </h1>
    <p>Clad in plate armor that gleams in the sunlight despite the dust and grime of long travel, a human lays down her sword and shield and places her hands on a mortally wounded man. Divine radiance shines from her hands, the man’s wounds knit closed, and his eyes open wide with amazement.</p>
    <p>A dwarf crouches behind an outcrop, his black cloak making him nearly invisible in the night, and watches an orc war band celebrating its recent victory. Silently, he stalks into their midst and whispers an oath, and two orcs are dead before they even realize he is there.</p>
    <p>Silver hair shining in a shaft of light that seems to illuminate only him, an elf laughs with exultation. His spear flashes like his eyes as he jabs again and again at a twisted giant, until at last his light overcomes its hideous darkness.</p>
    <p>Whatever their origin and their mission, paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of evil. Whether sworn before a god’s altar and the witness of a priest, in a sacred glade before nature spirits and fey beings, or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a paladin’s oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.</p>

                <a class="headerlink" href="#the-cause-of-righteousness" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>
            </h3>
            <p>A paladin swears to uphold justice and righteousness, to stand with the good things of the world against the encroaching darkness, and to hunt the forces of evil wherever they lurk. Different paladins focus on various aspects of the cause of righteousness, but all are bound by the oaths that grant them power to do their sacred work. Although many paladins are devoted to gods of good. a paladin’s power comes as much from a commitment to justice itself as it does from a god.</p>
            <p>Paladins train for years to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the sick and injured, to smite the wicked and the undead, and to protect the innocent and those who join them in the fight for justice.</p>

            <h3>Beyond the Mundane Life
                <a class="headerlink" href="#beyond-the-mundane-life" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>
            </h3>
            <p>Almost by definition, the life of a paladin is an adventuring life. Unless a lasting injury has taken him or her away from adventuring for a time, every paladin lives on the front lines of the cosmic struggle against evil. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the militias and armies of the world, but even fewer people can claim the true calling of a paladin. When they do receive the call, these warriors turn from their former occupations and take up arms to fight evil. Sometimes their oaths lead them into the service of the crown as leaders of elite groups of knights, but even then their loyalty is first to the cause of righteousness, not to crown and country.</p>
            <p>Adventuring paladins take their work seriously. A delve into an ancient ruin or dusty crypt can be a quest driven by a higher purpose than the acquisition of treasure. Evil lurks in dungeons and primeval forests, and even the smallest victory against it can tilt the cosmic balance away from oblivion.</p>

            <h3>Breaking your Oath
                <a class="headerlink" href="#breaking-your-oath" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>
            </h3>
            <p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards ofconduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser oftwo evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p>
            <p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin ofthe same order. The paladin might spend an all- night vigil in prayer as a Sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act ofself—denial. After a rite ofconfession and Forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p>
            <p>Ifa paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the DM&#8217;s discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another, or perhaps to take the Oathbreaker paladin option that appears in the Dungeon Master’s Guide.</p>

            <h3>Creating a Paladin
                <a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-paladin" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>
            </h3>
            <p>The most important aspect of a paladin character is the nature of his or her holy quest. Although the class features related to your oath don’t appear until you reach 3rd level, plan ahead for that choice by reading the oath descriptions at the end of the class. Are you a devoted servant of good, loyal to the gods of justice and honor, a holy knight in shining armor venturing forth to smite evil? Are you a glorious champion of the light. cherishing everything beautiful that stands against the shadow, a knight whose oath descends from traditions older than many of the gods? Or are you an embittered loner sworn to take vengeance on those who have done great evil, sent as an angel of death by the gods or driven by your need for revenge? Appendix B lists many deities worshiped by paladins throughout the multiverse, such as Torm, Tyr, Heironeous, Paladine, Kiri-Jolith, Dol Arrah, the Silver Flame, Bahamut, Athena, Re-Horakhty, and Heimdall.</p>
            <p>How did you experience your call to serve as a paladin? Did you hear a whisper from an unseen god or angel while you were at prayer? Did another paladin sense the potential within you and decide to train you as a squire? Or did some terrible eventithe destruction of your home, perhaps— drive you to your quests? Perhaps you stumbled into a sacred grove or a hidden elven enclave and found yourself called to protect all such refuges of goodness and beauty. Or you might have known from your earliest memories that the paladin’s life was your calling, almost as if you had been sent into the world with that purpose stamped on your soul.</p>
            <p>As guardians against the forces of wickedness, paladins are rarely of any evil alignment. Most of them walk the paths of charity and justice. Consider how your alignment colors the way you pursue your holy quest and the manner in which you conduct yourself before gods and mortals. Your oath and alignment might be in harmony, or your oath might represent standards of behavior that you have not yet attained.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>Becoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to the cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness. The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this class don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin&#8217;s heart.</p>

                <a class="headerlink" href="#oath-of-devotion" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>
            </h3>
            <p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals ofjustice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.</p>

                <p><strong>Sacred Weapon.</strong> As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon als emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.</p>
                <p>You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. Ifyou are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.</p>
                <p><strong>Turn the Unholy.</strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p>
                <p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>

            <p>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things—leaves, antlers, or flowers—t0 reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.</p>

                </h4>
                <p>The tenets of the Oath of the Ancients have been preserved for uncounted centuries. This oath emphasizes the principles of good above any concerns of law or chaos. Its four central principles are simple.</p>
                <p><strong>Kindle the Light.</strong> Through your acts of mercy, kindness, and forgiveness, kindle the light of hope in th world, beating back despair.</p>
                <p><strong>Shelter the Light.</strong> Where there is good, beauty, love, and laughter in the world, stand against the wickedness that would swallow it. Where life flourishes, stand against the forces that would render it barren.</p>
                <p><strong>Preserve Your Own Light.</strong> Delight in song and laughter, in beauty and art. If you allow the light to die in your own heart, you can&#8217;t preserve it in the world.</p>
                <p><strong>Be the Light.</strong> Be a glorious beacon for all who live in despair. Let the light of your joy and courage shine forth in all your deeds.</p>

When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods. when a thieves’ guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countrysideiat times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong.

            <p>The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary.

The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.</p>
            <p><strong>Fight the Greater Evil.</strong> Faced with a choice of fightin my sworn foes or combating a lesser evil. I choose the greater evil.</p>
            <p><strong>No Mercy for the Wicked.</strong> Ordinary foes might win my mercy, but my sworn enemies do not.</p>
            <p><strong>By Any Means Necessary.</strong> My qualms can’t get in the way of exterminating my foes.</p>
            <p><strong>Restitution.</strong> If my foes wreak ruin on the world, it is because I failed to stop them. I must help those harmed by their misdeeds.</p>

                </h4>
                <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
                <p><strong>Abjure Enemy.</strong> As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer of denunciation, using your Channel Divinity. Choose one creature within 60 feet of you that you can see. That creature must make a Wisdom saving throw, unless it is immune to being frightened. Fiends and undead have disadvantage on this saving throw.</p>
                <p>On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While frightened, the creature’s speed is O, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.</p>
                <p>On a successful save, the creature’s speed is halved for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p>
                <p><strong>Vow ofEnmity.</strong> As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.</p>

                </h4>
                <p>By 7th level, your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe’s retreat. When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, you can move up to half your speed immediately after the attack and as part of the same reaction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.</p>

                </h4>
                <p>Starting at 15th level, the authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.</p>

                <p>At 20th level, you can assume the form of an angelic avenger. Using your action, you undergo a transformation. For 1 hour, you gain the following benefits:
                </p>
                <ul class="simple">
                    <li>Wings sprout from your back and grant you a flying speed of 60 feet.</li>
                    <li>You emanate an aura of menace in a 30-foot radius. The first time any enemy creature enters the aura or starts its turn there during a battle, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become fright, ened of you for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. Attack rolls against the frightened creature have advantage.
                    </li>
                    <li>Once you use this feature, you can&#8217;t use it again until you finish a long rest.</li>
