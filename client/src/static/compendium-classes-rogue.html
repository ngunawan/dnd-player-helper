    </h1>
    <p>Signaling for her companions to wait, a halfling creeps forward through the dungeon hall. She presses an ear to the door, then pulls out a set of tools and picks the lock in the blink of an eye. Then she disappears into the shadows as her fighter friend moves forward to kick the door open.</p>
    <p>A human lurks in the shadows of an alley while his accomplice prepares for her part in the ambush. When their target, a notorious slaver, passes the alleyway, the accomplice cries out, the slaver comes to investigate, and the assassin’s blade cuts his throat before he can make a sound.</p>
    <p>Suppressing a giggle, a gnome waggles her fingers and magically lifts the key ring from the guards belt. In a moment, the keys are in her hand, the cell door is open, and she and her companions are free to make their escape.</p>
    <p>Rogues rely on skill, stealth, and their foes’ vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem, demonstrating a resourcefulness and versatility that is the cornerstone of any successful adventuring party.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>Rogues devote as much effort to mastering the use of a variety of skills as they do to perfecting their combat abilities, giving them a broad expertise that few other characters can match. Many rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine the skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps, and opening locks.</p>
            <p>When it comes to combat, rogues prioritize cunning over brute strength. A rogue would rather make one precise strike, placing it exactly where the attack will hurt the target most, than wear an opponent down with a barrage of attacks. Rogues have an almost supernatural knack for avoiding danger, and a few learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities.</p>

                <a class="headerlink" href="#a-shady-living" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>
            </h3>
            <p>Every town and city has its share of rogues. Most of them live up to the worst stereotypes of the class, making a living as burglars, assassins, cutpurses, and con artists. Often, these scoundrels are organized into thieves’ guilds or crime families. Plenty of rogues operate independently, but even they sometimes recruit apprentices to help them in their scams and heists. A few rogues make an honest living as locksmiths. investigators, or exterminators, which can be a dangerous job in a world where dire rats—and wererats—haunt the sewers.</p>
            <p>As adventurers, rogues fall on both sides of the law. Some are hardened criminals who decide to seek their fortune in treasure hoards, while others take up a life of adventure to escape from the law. Some have learned and perfected their skills with the explicit purpose of infiltrating ancient ruins and hidden crypts in search of treasure.</p>

                <a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-rogue" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>
            </h3>
            <p>As you create your rogue character, consider the character’s relationship to the law. Do you have a criminal past—or present? Are you on the run from the law or from an angry thieves’ guild master? Or did you leave your guild in search of bigger risks and bigger rewards? Is it greed that drives you in your adventures. or some other desire or ideal?</p>
            <p>What was the trigger that led you away from your previous life? Did a great con or heist gone terribly wrong cause you to reevaluate your career? Maybe you were lucky and a successful robbery gave you the coin you needed to escape the squalor of your life.</p>
            <p>Did wanderlust finally call you away from your home? Perhaps you suddenly found yourself out off from your family or your mentor, and you had to find a new means of support. Or maybe you made a new friend—another member of your adventuring party—who showed you new possibilities for earning a living and employing your particular talents.</p>

                <p>You can make a rogue quickly by following these suggestions. First. Dexterity should be your highest ability score. Make Intelligence your next—highest if you want to excel at Investigation or plan to take up the Arcane Trickster archetype.

In addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used to convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is dangerous or the territory of a thieves&#8217; guild, whether loot is nearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will provide a safe house for thieves on the run.</p>

            <p>Some rogues enhance their fine—honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters, mischief—makers, and a significant number of adventurers.</p>

                </h4>
                <p>When you reach 3rd level, you gain the ability to cast spells. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the wizard spell list.</p>
                <p><strong>Cantrips.</strong> You learn three cantrips: mage hand and two other cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
                <p><strong>Spell Slots.</strong> The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of lst level and higher. To cast one of these spells. you must expend a slot of the spell&#8217;s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
                <p>For example, if you know the lst—level spell charm person and have a lst—level and a 2nd—level spell slot available, you can cast charm person using either slot.</p>
                <p><strong>Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.</strong> You know three lst—level wizard spells of your choice, two of whic you must choose from the enchantment and illusion spells on the wizard spell list.</p>
                <p>The Spells Known column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice, and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class. you can learn one new spell of lst or 2nd level.</p>
                <p>The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.</p>
                <p>Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots. and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell. unless you’re replacing the spell you gained at 8th, 14th. or 20th level.</p>

                <p>At 17th level, you gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.</p>
                <p>Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a saving throw with its spellcasting ability modifier. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell&#8217;s effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least lst level and of a level you can cast (it doesn’t need to be a wizard spell). For the next 8 hours. you know the spell and can cast it using your spell slots. The creature can’t cast that spell until the 8 hours have passed.</p>
                <p>Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.</p>
