    <p>Elves area magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests orin silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.</p>

        <h2>Slender and Graceful
            <a class="headerlink" href="#slender-and-graceful" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>
        </h2>
        <p>With their unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful to humans and members of many other races. They are slightly shorter than humans on average, ranging from well under 5 feet tall to just over 6 feet. They are more slender than humans, weighing only 100 to 145 pounds. Males and females are about the same height, and males are only marginally heavier than females.</p>
        <p>Elves’ coloration encompasses the normal human range and also includes skin in shades of copper, bronze, and almost bluish-white, hair of green or blue, and eyes like pools of liquid gold or silver. Elves have no facial and little body hair. They favor elegant cloth in gin bright colors, and they enjoy simple yet lovely jewelry.</p>

        <h2>A Timeless Perspective
            <a class="headerlink" href="#a-timeless-perspective" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>
        </h2>
        <p>Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them abroad perspective on events that might trouble the shorterlived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning anew skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.</p>
        <p>Like the branches of a young tree, elves are flexible in the face of danger. They trust in diplomacy and compromise to resolve differences before they escalate to violence. They have been known to retreat from intrusions into their woodland homes, confident that they can simply wait the invaders out. But when the need arises, elves reveal astern martial side, demonstrating skill with sword, bow, and strategy.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>Most elves dwell in small forest villages hidden among the trees. Elves hunt game, gather food, and grow vegetables, and their skill and magic allow them to support themselves without the need for clearing and plow in gland. They are talented artisans, crafting finely worked clothes and art objects. Their contact with outsiders is usually limited, though a few elves make a good living by trading crafted items for metals (which they have no interest in mining).
        </p>
        <p>Elves encountered outside their own lands are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages. Human nobles compete for the services of elf instructors to teach swordplay or magic to their children.</p>

        <h2>Exploration and Adventure
            <a class="headerlink" href="#exploration-and-adventure" title="Permalink to this headline"></a>
        </h2>
        <p>Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day today but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.

        </h2>
        <p>Although they can be haughty, elves are generally gracious even to those who fall short of their high expectations— which is most non-elves. Still, they can find good in just about anyone.</p>
        <p><strong>Dwarves.</strong> “ Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs. But what they lack in humor, sophistication, and manners, they makeup in valor. And I must admit, their best smiths produce art that approaches elven quality. ”

        <p><strong>Halflings.</strong> “ Halflings are people of simple pleasures, and that is not a quality to scorn. They’re good folk, they care for each other and tend their gardens, and they have proven themselves tougher than they seem when the need arises. ”

        <p><strong>Humans.</strong> “All that haste, their ambition and drive to accomplish something before their brief lives pass away— human endeavors seem so futile sometimes.

An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>
        <p><strong>Alignment.</strong> Elves love freedom, variety, and selfexpression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others&#8217; freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not. The d row are an exception; their exile into the Underdark has made them vicious and dangerous. Drow are more often evil than not.</p>
        <p><strong>Size.</strong> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>

        <p><strong>Fey Ancestry.</strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>

(The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
        <p><strong>Languages.</strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their song sand poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>

        <p>Were it not for one renowned exception, the race of drow would be universally reviled. To most, they area race of demon-worshiping marauders dwelling in the subterranean depths of the Underdark, emerging only on the blackest nights to pillage and slaughter the surface dwellers they despise. Their society is depraved and preoccupied with the favor of Lolth, their spider-goddess, who sanctions murder and the extermination of entire families as noble houses vie for position. Yet one drow, at least, broke the mold. In the world of the Forgotten Realms, DrizztDo&#8217;Urden, ranger of the North, has proven his quality as a good-hearted defender of the weak and innocent. Rejecting his heritage and adrift ina world that looks upon him with terror and loathing, Drizzt is a model for those few drow who follow in his footsteps, trying to find a life apart from the evil society of their Underdark homes. Drow grow up believing that surface-dwelling races are inferior, worthless except as slaves. Drow who develop a conscience or find it necessary to cooperate with members of other races find it hard to overcome that prejudice, especially when they are so often on the receiving end of hatred.</p>
